# Connect Four - Game AI

Welcome to the ConnectFour Game AI repository! This project features an AI agent that plays the ConnectFour game using a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. This project was made as part of the Artificial Intelligence class at the University of South Carolina under the supervision of Professor Forest Agostinelli.


## Features
- ConnectFour game environment
- AI agent using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Human vs AI, AI vs random moves (for testing porposes)
- Visualization of gameplay
- Heuristic evaluation for AI decision-making
